         Introduction to Natural Laguage Processing Assignment 2
 
==========================================================================================

1. In this assignment, you will be asked to:

  From Incrementality in Deterministic Dependency Parsing(2004, Nivre)
  - implement the arc-standard algorithm

  From A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks(2014, Danqi and Manning) 
  - implement feature extraction
  - implement the neural network architecture including activation function
  - implement loss function


2. This package contains several files:

  - DependencyParser.py: 
    This file is the main script for training your dependency parser.

  - DependencyTree.py
    The dependency tree class file.

  - ParsingSystem.py
    This file contains the class for a transition-based parsing framework for dependency parsing.

  - Configuration.py
    The configuration class file.

  - Config.py
    This file contains all hyperparameters. 

  - Util.py
    This file contains functions for reading and writing CONLL file. 

  - data/
    train.conll - train set, labeld
    dev.conll - dev set, labeld
    test.conll - test set, unlabeled


3. What you should do:
  1. Implement the arc-standard algorithm in ParsingSystem.py
  2. Implement feature extraction in DependencyParser.py
  3. Implement neural network architecture including activation function
  4. Implement loss function and calculate loss value
  5. Try different number of hidden layers
  6. Try different non-linear activation functions
  7. Train a parser with Fixed embeddings -- by setting traiable=False in tf.Variable
  8. Try different word embeddings -- Cross Entropy loss vs. NCE loss


4. What you should submit:

  Creating a single zip file contains the following files:
      1. DependencyParser.py
      2. ParsingSystem.py
      3. Configuration.py
      4. Prediction on the test set (will be saved as result.conll)
      5. Readme file with explanation of your implementation
      6. Report as detailed in the assignment pdf
